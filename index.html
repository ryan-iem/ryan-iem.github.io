                <p>After a brief year at NAB as a Technology Intern, I made the difficult decision 
                    to say goodbye and move to Japan on a Working Holiday Visa to pursue a lifelong 
                    dream of mine. From there, in only three short years, I was able to improve my 
                    Japanese from complete beginner to near conversational/business-level proficiency 
                    (~N2 level) all through self-study - something I deeply pride myself on. During my 
                    time there, I lived in various cities, interacted with people from all walks of 
                    life, and had the amazing and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent Australia 
                    on the world stage at Expo 2025 Osaka. All of which greatly contributed to bettering 
                    my soft skills and getting me excited about where I would end up next...</p>
                <p>However, even throughout my time in Japan, IT always remained at the back of my mind. 
                    I’ve been passionate about the world of IT since I was young and always knew I would 
                    eventually return to it. After taking time off to realise my lifelong dream, I’m now 
                    content with my Japanese proficiency and ready to once again take on the world of 
                    Information Technology.</p>
                <p>You’ll find me motivated about IT, adventurous in my problem-solving and eager to learn 
                    the latest technologies. Then, outside of work, I'm a big fan of music, Japanese 
                    literature, whisky, cafes and cats 🐱</p>
